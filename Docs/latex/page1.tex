The following images illustrate the U\+ML diagrams of the P\+I\+TS software. These U\+ML diagrams are divided into three sections,
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sprint 1 \+: Containing the initlial U\+ML diagrams
\item Sprint 2 \+: Containing the expanded U\+ML diagrams
\item Sprint 3 \+: Containing the final U\+ML diagrams.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Furthermore this page shall contain the use case diagram alonside the deployment diagram.\hypertarget{Information_subsection1}{}\subsection{Sprint 1 U\+M\+L Diagrams}\label{Information_subsection1}
The Sprint 1 uml diagrams  \hypertarget{Information_subsection2}{}\subsection{Sprint 2 U\+M\+L Diagrams}\label{Information_subsection2}
The Sprint 2 uml diagram, due to the size of the diagram it has been divided into two parts.
